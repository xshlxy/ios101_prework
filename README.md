## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. Instagram - I like how it catches my attention and the UI is very simple to use.
2. Netflix - I like the dark mode, which makes it feel more cozy. I also like the different carousels for movies/shows.
3. Messages - I like how clean and straight to the point it is. I like the way you can pin contacts at the top.

I would like to build a web app designed to help Latin-American immigrant children adapt to American culture and language. The app would feature interactive flashcards to build vocabulary, story-based lessons to teach basic grammar, and matching activities to reinforce learning. For cultural exploration, it would include animated stories introducing U.S. traditions and an interactive map highlighting cultural landmarks. To keep users engaged, the app would use gamification, offering points, badges, and mini-games as rewards for progress. The goal is to create a fun, accessible tool that supports young learners in building confidence and adapting to their new environment.
## Notes

One challenege was understanding the number of the colors because I wanted to make the background color pastel, but I figured it out and made it look good.
